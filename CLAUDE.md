- In this project, when I refer to "the logo" - I mean ConvoLab with the 2 icons to the right of the text. So, if I say to make the logo bigger, think of these items as a unit and make both of them larger by the same increment.

- Test credentials for local development are in `.env` under `TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`. Use these when testing the app with Playwright or manually.
