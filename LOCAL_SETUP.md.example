# Local Development Setup

This file contains instructions for accessing production credentials and setting up your local development environment. **This is a template file** - copy it to `LOCAL_SETUP.md` (which is gitignored) and fill in the actual values.

## Database Configuration for Worktrees

When creating a new git worktree, the `server/.env` file must be configured correctly:

**CRITICAL**: Use this DATABASE_URL (replace `YOUR_MAC_USERNAME` with your actual username):
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_MAC_USERNAME@localhost:5432/languageflow?schema=public"
```

**To find your Mac username**: Run `whoami` in terminal

**Why**: Worktrees need to use the local Mac superuser instead of the Docker `languageflow` user. Using the Docker user will cause Prisma connection errors like "User `languageflow` was denied access on the database `languageflow.public`"

## Production API Keys

### Fish Audio & ElevenLabs API Keys

For local testing of TTS features, you'll need to copy API keys from production:

**SSH Command** (replace `YOUR_PRODUCTION_SERVER` with actual hostname):
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_PRODUCTION_SERVER 'cd /opt/convolab && docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T server env | grep -E "FISH_AUDIO|ELEVENLABS"'
```

Add these to your `server/.env` file:
```bash
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=your-key-here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

**Security Notes**:
- Only use production API keys for local development if absolutely necessary
- Consider getting development/test API keys from the providers directly
- Never commit `LOCAL_SETUP.md` with real credentials
- Never commit `server/.env` with production keys

## Other Production Credentials

Add any other production access instructions here as needed. Remember to keep the actual `LOCAL_SETUP.md` file private and gitignored.
