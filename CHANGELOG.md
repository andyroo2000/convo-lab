## Unreleased

### Improved

- **[perf]** Audio course generation performance dramatically improved by properly optimizing TTS batching - fixed root cause where alternating narrator/speaker voices created excessive batches; now all units with same voice/speed/language are grouped together regardless of script position; reduced TTS API calls by 99% from 534 to 3-5 batches per 30-minute course; course generation time reduced from 21+ hours to 15-30 minutes; added admin utility scripts kill-active-course-jobs.ts and reset-course-status.ts for managing course generation
- **[chore]** Fixed 61 ESLint errors across client codebase - eliminated all 57 errors including unused eslint-disable directives (10), nested ternaries (7), testing-library violations (20), await-in-loop patterns (7), promise executor returns (4), continue statements (2), restricted syntax (2), consistent-return (1), and restricted-globals (1); remaining 91 warnings are all @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any types flagged for future type improvement

### Added

- **[chore]** Utility script for fixing common furigana errors in Japanese dialogues - added fix-furigana-errors.ts script to correct misreadings like この前[ぜん]→この前[まえ], 何[なん]→何[なに] before particles, 私[わたくし]→私[わたし], and other common mistakes; supports filtering by user ID and provides detailed fix reporting

- **[chore]** Production data migration scripts - added three migration scripts to sync local sample content to production database: migrate-sample-courses.ts (migrates 29 sample audio courses), sync-avatar-urls.ts (syncs speaker avatar URLs for sample dialogues), and sync-arabic-avatars.ts (syncs Arabic speaker avatars by name matching); successfully migrated 5 new sample courses and 20 Arabic speaker avatars to production, avoiding the need to regenerate audio and images

### Fixed

- **[fix]** Client error display bug showing "[object Object]" instead of actual error messages - fixed CourseGenerator and other components to properly extract error messages from nested API response format ({ error: { message } }); users now see helpful messages like "Please verify your email..." instead of confusing error objects
- **[fix]** Production signup "failed to fetch" error with async email queue - resolved issue where users saw network errors despite successful account creation by making verification email sending asynchronous via BullMQ; implemented idempotent signup to handle retry scenarios gracefully (users can retry without "already exists" errors); added comprehensive [SIGNUP] logging for monitoring; added slow request tracking (>5s for signup, >2s for others); improved client error messaging for network failures; signup responses now complete in <2s with email queued in background with 3 automatic retries

### Added

- **[chore]** Admin tools for user email verification management - added 9 utility scripts for debugging and managing users: verify-user-email.ts (manually verify emails), resend-verification-email.ts (resend verification emails), get-verification-link.ts (get verification links), find-unverified-users.ts (find users needing verification), check-user-courses.ts (view user courses), trigger-course-generation.ts (manually trigger generation), check-course-user.ts (get course details), check-db-connection.ts (verify database), find-recent-courses.ts (find recent courses)
- **[fix]** TypeScript compilation errors and ESLint warnings - resolved type errors in courseQueue.ts (Prisma JsonValue casting), auth.ts (proper types for Prisma updates, Express user, JWT payload), and audioExtractorService.ts (removed unused interface, proper type casting); added appropriate eslint-disable comments for necessary console logging; fixed checkGenerationLimit call to include contentType parameter; updated test expectations for isSampleContent field; added test credentials to server/.env.example

### Changed

- **[style]** Restored font sizes to pre-flashcard styling - reverted Japanese text (2.5rem → 1.5rem, weight 600 → 500) and Chinese text (2.5rem → 2.25rem, weight 600 → 500) to original sizes that existed before flashcard feature; the flashcard feature had increased font sizes for card display but unintentionally affected text rendering throughout the entire application
- **[chore]** Code cleanup and environment documentation - removed development console.log statements from client components (AvatarCropperModal, ChunkPackExamplesPage, NarrowListeningCreatorPage, PISessionPage, PlaybackPage); added comprehensive .env.example for client with Stripe and API configuration; expanded server .env.example with all required variables (OAuth, email, AWS, Stripe, admin emails, worker config); updated README with detailed PWA usage instructions including iOS and Android installation steps, offline support details, and service worker caching configuration

### Removed

- **[refactor]** Complete removal of flashcard/SRS feature - removed all flashcard and spaced repetition system functionality including ReviewPage, DeckEditorPage, flashcard components, SRS routes and service, Deck/Card/Review database models, and flashcardsEnabled feature flag; this simplifies the application by ~4,700 lines of code and speeds up audio course generation by eliminating flashcard audio synthesis

### Added

- **[feat]** Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation with offline support - configured VitePWA plugin with service worker and web app manifest; generated PWA icons (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon); created PWAInstallPrompt component with platform-specific install flows for iOS Safari and Android/Chrome; implemented Workbox runtime caching strategies for fonts, API calls (5-minute cache), and audio files (30-day cache); added PWA meta tags for standalone app mode with theme color and viewport-fit configuration
- **[feat]** Mobile touch target optimization for 44px accessibility standard - increased navigation buttons height from 36px to 44px on mobile devices; enlarged user menu button to 44px minimum with proper padding; adjusted library filter buttons vertical padding to achieve 44px height; resized audio player controls (play/pause and repeat buttons) from 40px to 44px for easier tapping
- **[feat]** Sample content onboarding with guided user experience - created SampleContentGuide component to welcome new users and highlight pre-generated content with sample badges; added CustomContentGuide component explaining how to create personalized dialogues and courses; implemented ProtectedByFeatureFlag wrapper component for feature-gated routes; added database migrations for seenSampleContentGuide and seenCustomContentGuide user tracking fields
- **[feat]** Flashcards feature flag for phased rollout - added flashcardsEnabled flag to FeatureFlags database table; updated feature flag hooks and contexts to support new flag; integrated feature flag checks in navigation and route protection
- **[test]** Comprehensive upgrade prompt test coverage for all content creation flows (24 tests total across DialogueGenerator, CourseGenerator, NarrowListeningCreatorPage, PISetupPage, and ChunkPackSetupPage)
- **[feat]** Upgrade prompts when quota limits reached - implemented modal prompts that automatically appear when users hit their generation quotas; integrated into dialogue and course generators; captures quota metadata (used, limit, resetsAt) from 429 error responses; free tier users see lifetime limit messaging with upgrade CTA; paid tier users see monthly reset info; includes e2e test infrastructure improvements (seed script, port fixes, dotenv config)
- **[test]** Updated quota-system e2e tests for tier-based quotas - modified e2e tests to reflect new tier-based quota system with lifetime per-content-type limits for free tier (2 dialogues) instead of weekly limits; updated test assertions to use flexible regex patterns instead of hardcoded values; skipped tests not applicable to free tier (80-89% usage range, quota reset dates); updated error message assertions from "Weekly quota exceeded" to "Quota exceeded"
- **[feat]** Tier-based quota system with lifetime and monthly limits - implemented differentiated quota system for free and paid tiers; free tier has lifetime per-content-type limits (2 dialogues + 1 audio course); paid tier has 30 generations per month combined across all content types; admin users have unlimited access; converted rateLimitGeneration to factory function accepting contentType parameter; updated all route handlers to use new factory pattern; added 39 comprehensive unit tests for quota system; updated integration tests for new quota behavior; updated error messages to be tier-agnostic
- **[feat]** Monthly date utilities for paid tier quota management - added getMonthStart and getNextMonthStart functions to support monthly quota cycle (30 generations per month, resetting on 1st of each month); functions handle month boundaries, year transitions, leap years, and all edge cases; added 26 comprehensive tests covering mid-month scenarios, year boundaries, leap years, and all 12 months validation
- **[feat]** MVP UX improvements for pricing and language selection - replaced "Native Language" with "Primary Language" throughout UI (onboarding and settings); removed country flags from language selection in favor of text-only names (e.g., "Japanese", "Spanish") for a more inclusive design; updated all pricing displays to reflect $10/month with 30 generations per month for paid tier and "2 dialogues + 1 audio course (lifetime)" for free tier; changed quota reset messaging from weekly to monthly cycles
- **[docs]** MVP content topics and pricing decisions - finalized 3 dialogue topics (Meeting Someone New, At a Café/Restaurant, Making Weekend Plans) and 1 audio course topic (Travel & Transportation) for pre-generated sample content; set paid tier pricing at $10/month with 30 items per month; defined free tier limits (2 dialogues + 1 audio course lifetime); decided to replace "native language" terminology with "Primary Language" and remove country flags in favor of language names only
- **[chore]** Beads issue tracking system for MVP planning - initialized Beads as a persistent, git-backed issue tracker for managing the MVP launch roadmap; setup includes global npm installation, git hooks for automatic JSONL sync, MCP server integration with Claude Code, AGENTS.md workflow documentation, and .gitattributes for smart merging; created initial MVP roadmap with 23 tasks organized into 7 epics (pre-generated sample content, onboarding UX improvements, user guidance pulse points, free vs paid tier definition, flashcard improvements, analytics tracking, and final polish)
- **[feat]** Full sentence furigana support for SRS flashcards - flashcards now display furigana for entire sentences instead of just the target vocabulary word, improving reading comprehension and context understanding; added furiganaService using kuroshiro library for automatic furigana generation; implemented smart sentence parsing logic to correctly extract and render vocabulary words with split furigana annotations (e.g., 予[よ]定[てい]); created backfill script for existing cards; added comprehensive FlashCard test coverage; changed English translation toggle default to off for better learning flow; fixed CurrentTextDisplay container height jumping issue
